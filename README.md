# SmartApartment

ECE Senior Design Project by Danny Lewis, George Long, Roy Thorstensen, and Olivia Kapp.

Android app was built for Samsung Galaxy S10, but should function on any Android device.

Smart_Hub_Code, Smart_Light_Code, and Smart_Shade_Code folders contain the code and schematics to get the three physical HUZZAH boards created and functional.

See "Final Report.pdf" (coming soon) for more details on this project and its uses.

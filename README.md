# SmartApartment

ECE Senior Design Project by Danny Lewis, George Long, Roy Thorstensen, and Olivia Kapp.

Android app was built for Samsung Galaxy S10, but should function on any Android device (Android 6.0+). Volley required.

Smart_Hub_Code, Smart_Light_Code, and Smart_Shade_Code folders contain the code and guides for powering the HUZZAH boards.

KiCadProjects contains the schematics for the devices, as well as the PCB designs.

3DPrints contains STL files for various prints that make up enclosures and supporting peices.

See "Final Report.pdf" (coming soon) for more details on this project and its uses.
